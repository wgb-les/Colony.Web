                                <li>To prevent marking, always use the soft brush attachment with the vacuum cleaner</li>
                                <li>Avoid placing heavy objects on newly painted woodwork and metalwork for at least a week.</li>

                            <h3>Cleaning</h3>
                            <p>Use a diluted lukewarm solution of domestic washing up liquid and a clean sponge or lint-free cloth. Ensure your sponge or cloth is wet but not dripping.</p>
                            <p>Dab the affected area and repeat as required. Be particularly gentle with emulsion-painted surfaces and avoid rubbing or circular motions as this may polish up the surface. For textured walls, a cloth should be used rather than a sponge.</p>
                            <p>Ensure radiators are at room temperature before attempting to clean them. Cleaning a hot radiator may result in localised or uneven polishing of the surface.</p>

                            <h3>Repair</h3>

                            <p>Lightly rub down the damaged area and apply a suitable primer to any exposed wood or metal. Repaint the damaged area with one or two coats as required. Stand-alone items (such as window frames and doors) may need completely repainting to avoid seeing any ‘joins’ between the existing finish and the repair.</p>
