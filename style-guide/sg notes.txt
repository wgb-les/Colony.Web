The UI pattern library has been created for and is now included within the Style Library project and is under TFS cource control.

What is a pattern library?


A UI pattern library provides:

- a code reference for commonly used UI elements to ensure consistency by developers

- a visual reference library for designers

- it assists testing and rapid protyping by providing a single page visual representation of common UI elements during development sprints (since it makes use of the site's current stylesheets).


Where is it?
--------------

The pattern library is currently only visible from within your local project but will be on dev with the next deploy. 

The Pattern Library may be accessed via the url suffix ~/style-guide/ e.g. http://stylelibrary.colonynext.co.uk/style-guide/ 

The pattern library is built on PHP, so to view on your local machine you will need to install PHP via https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx.


How is it used?
------------------

If you construct markup please refer to the pattern library for consistency.

If you modify or create new UI elements please add them to the pattern library. To add a ui element to the pattern library create a suitably named code pattern .html file within ~/style-guide/markup/patterns/.
